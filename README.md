# chinese-chrome

Forked from peraperakun/chinese-chrome to convert that project to firefox. Since the new firefox quantum update, the old firefox version stopped working. 
Discussed here: http://www.perapera.org/perapera-firefox/

If you request features or anything, you can do so via github or via the comment section on the mozilla extension page. 
If it's a reasonable request, then I will try to do it as soon as I have some spare time.
